# FACE-RECOGNITION( VERY SIMPLE)
very first project to detect face and recognise it using 'face-recognition' library and ofc with opencv


if you want ur face instead of mine just put ur photo(that pic must show all parts of ur face clearly) by making a folder of your name in the 'known_faces' folder, then throw some ramdon pics which you have taken  in your bathroom in  the 'unknown_faces' and run the test.py file from cmd.  






this program required:
python=3.7.8 or above
any text editor(vscode,sublime,atom)
libraries like DLIB,OPENCV,FACE-RECOGNITION
